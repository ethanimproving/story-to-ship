# run-scenario.sh -- performs or prints the mechanical steps for one
# Definition of Done (DoD) fixture scenario: which DoD document (canon)
# fixture to place at docs/DOD.md, where to find the request or claim
# text to feed the dispatched agent skill, and how to invoke
# check-markers.sh against the transcript afterward.
#
# This script does NOT dispatch the agent skill itself -- that requires an
# actual agent session, and every dispatch is a spend-bearing operation
# (get the user's explicit consent first; see README.md Section 4). It
# only does the file-system setup (or prints it, if no worktree is given)
# and prints the remaining manual steps. Pass --check to also run
# check-markers.sh against a transcript you already captured. Three
# scenarios, dirty-canon, dirty-canon-generator, and malformed-canon,
# additionally create one baseline commit inside the scratch worktree and
# then apply a pinned mutation on top of it (or, if no worktree is given,
# print those commands instead of running them) -- see their case
# entries below.

Usage:

  run-scenario.sh <scenario> [--worktree <path>] [--check <transcript-file>]
  run-scenario.sh --help

<scenario> is one of:
  violating-story         story-generator refusal (story-request-scenarios.md Case A)
  compliant-story         story-generator negative control (story-request-scenarios.md Case B)
  no-canon-fallback       story-generator, no docs/DOD.md present (story-request-scenarios.md Case C)
  story-stale-canon       story-generator, stale document (story-request-scenarios.md Case D)
  dirty-canon-generator   story-generator, uncommitted canon edit (story-request-scenarios.md Case B; no marker expected -- see below)
  evidence-missing        completion-gate failure (completion-claim-scenarios.md Case A)
  evidence-complete       completion-gate negative control (completion-claim-scenarios.md Case B; forbid-only screen -- see below)
  completion-stale-canon  completion-gate, stale document (completion-claim-scenarios.md Case C)
  delta-reratification    defining-done delta re-ratification interview (no marker check -- see below)
  dirty-canon             completion-gate, uncommitted canon edit (completion-claim-scenarios.md Case B; no marker expected -- see below)
  malformed-canon         completion-gate, unparseable canon (completion-claim-scenarios.md Case B; missing Stamp: line -- see below)

--worktree <path>   an existing scratch git working copy of this repo. If
                    given, the scenario's Definition of Done document is
                    copied to <path>/docs/DOD.md (or, for no-canon-fallback,
                    <path>/docs/DOD.md is removed if present). If omitted,
                    the script prints the cp/rm command instead of running it.
                    For dirty-canon, dirty-canon-generator, and
                    malformed-canon, the script additionally commits the
                    placed document inside <path> and then applies that
                    scenario's own pinned uncommitted edit on top of it
                    (or, if --worktree is omitted, prints those commands
                    instead of running them); dirty-canon and
                    dirty-canon-generator each edit an unrelated line in
                    their own placed document, malformed-canon deletes
                    the terminal Stamp: line. All three refuse to run at
                    all against <path> when <path> is this repository's
                    own working copy or a linked worktree of it, since
                    any of them would leave a real uncommitted edit in a
                    repo the scenario does not own.

--check <file>      a transcript file you already captured from dispatching
                    the agent skill. Runs check-markers.sh against it with
                    this scenario's --require/--forbid set. delta-reratification
                    has no marker check -- its correctness is read directly
                    from the transcript (only the new/changed layers should
                    be asked about; every prior ruling must be left
                    byte-identical) -- so --check is rejected for it.
                    evidence-complete's set is a single
                    --forbid 'DOD-GATE: FAIL' -- necessary but not
                    sufficient on its own: if it fails, read the emitted
                    line's stated reason before ruling a real finding vs.
                    a legitimate grounding-driven failure (see README.md
                    Section 3). dirty-canon's set is three --forbid
                    literals and no --require -- a negative control that
                    is necessary but not sufficient; its positive pass
                    condition is a transcript read (see README.md
                    Section 3), and its DOD-GATE: FAIL forbid carries the
                    same grounding-driven caveat as evidence-complete's.
                    dirty-canon-generator's set is likewise three
                    --forbid literals and no --require -- the
                    story-generator analogue of dirty-canon's negative
                    control, necessary but not sufficient; its positive
                    pass condition is also a transcript read (see
                    README.md Section 3). Unlike dirty-canon's, none of
                    its three forbids carries a grounding-driven caveat,
                    since the story generator has no DOD-GATE: FAIL
                    marker at all -- any RESULT: FAIL for this scenario
                    is a straightforward real finding.
                    malformed-canon's set is one --require and three
                    --forbid literals: --require 'DOD-MALFORMED:' (the
                    consumer's refusal marker for an unparseable canon)
                    plus --forbid on all three verdict markers
                    (DOD-VIOLATION:, DOD-GATE: FAIL, DOD-STALE: canon v),
                    since a consumer that refuses to evaluate the canon
                    must not also emit a verdict from evaluating it. This
                    check is close to a full pass condition on its own --
                    unlike evidence-complete and dirty-canon, malformed-canon
                    has no grounding-driven caveat on its DOD-GATE: FAIL
                    forbid, since a correctly-refusing consumer never
                    reaches evidence evaluation at all.

Every invocation is a dry run unless --worktree and/or --check are given:
with neither flag, the script only prints the steps for the named scenario.
