# Documentation Index

This is the top-level index for `docs/`, the cross-cutting level in the
documentation skill's taxonomy. It catalogs cross-cutting standards files
stored directly under `docs/` and links to domain-level
`docs/<domain>/INDEX.md` files as they are created. Every `docs/` directory
level owns its own INDEX.md; this one owns the root.

## Definition of Done canon

A repo may ratify a Definition of Done (DoD) canon: rulings on which
quality-gate layers apply here, and when. When ratified, the canon lives at
`docs/DOD.md` (a flat cross-cutting index, one line per layer), with
optional longer rationale in per-layer detail files at
`docs/dod/<group-slug>/<layer-key>.md`.

The canon is written and updated only by the `defining-done` skill's
ratification interview, which defines the authoring format -- no other
process creates or edits it.
The write order at ratification is: detail files, then their per-level index
chain under `docs/dod/` (subdomain `INDEX.md` files, then `docs/dod/INDEX.md`),
then `docs/DOD.md`, then this file's update. `docs/DOD.md` is written after
everything under `docs/dod/` and before this file's update, so its presence
is the reliable canon signal: if `docs/DOD.md` does not exist, no canon has
been ratified yet in this repo, and any DoD-aware tooling should fall back to
its canon-less default behavior. Once ratified, `docs/DOD.md` is catalogued
in the table below; detail files are catalogued by the `docs/dod/` index
chain (linked from the table), not listed here.

## Sprint engine

This repo carries a spec-driven multi-agent pipeline executor, packaged as
the self-contained `sprint-runner` skill. That skill is the usage guide, and
the engine's deeper documentation, schema, and tests live inside the
skill's own tools directory. The skill is packaged to ship whole as part of
the story-to-ship plugin, but that packaging has not been checked against a
live install yet.
