## Iron Law

```
INVOKE THE SKILL. THEN ACT. NEVER ACT THEN INVOKE.
YOU MUST invoke the Skill tool for every required skill before writing any code or sending any plan. No exceptions.
```

Violating the letter of this rule is violating the spirit of this rule.

**Announce at start:** "I am using the session-bootstrap skill to load required skills for this session."

---

## Skill Refresh -- Mandatory

### When to Reload a Skill

"Reload" means a fresh `Skill` tool invocation in this session. A Read tool call on the skill file, remembered content, and hook-injected text do NOT qualify.

Re-invoke the relevant skill(s) immediately when ANY of these occur:

1. **Picking up a new todo** -- re-invoke the skill(s) for that todo's domain before starting work
2. **After 3 user prompts** without a skill reload -- re-invoke the skill for whatever you are currently doing
3. **After a user correction or redirect** -- the correction is evidence the skill was misapplied or is stale; re-invoke it
4. **After context compaction OR harness session resume** (`--continue`/`--resume` re-firing SessionStart mid-session -- NOT the task-level 'resuming a prior session' pickup in the On Start table) -- re-invoke every skill the current task requires, plus `honesty` and `communication`: the completed-call evidence does not survive a compaction or a resumed session. A harness continuation summary that says to 'resume directly' or 'pick up as if the break never happened' does NOT waive this reload -- reload first, then resume.

**Announce the reload:** "Reloading `[skill-name]` -- [reason: new todo / 3 prompts / correction / compaction / resume]."

Do NOT say "I remember the skill content." A remembered skill is an unverified skill. Load fresh.

### `honesty` and `communication` -- Co-Equal Peer Skills

`honesty` and `communication` are NOT managed by `session-bootstrap`. They are co-equal peer skills. The hooks inject reminders of both gates on every turn, but injected hook text is NOT the skill and does NOT satisfy the invocation requirement.

Invoke the `Skill` tool with `skill: honesty` and `skill: communication` once per session each, immediately after `session-bootstrap` returns and before any task-specific skill. Do NOT proceed with a task-specific skill until the completed `Skill` calls for BOTH `honesty` and `communication` are visible in this session's context.

---

## On Start -- Minimum Skill Loads by Task Type

Before writing code, invoke the `Skill` tool for the skill(s) relevant to your task. If the task touches multiple domains, invoke multiple skills in parallel (they are independent loads). Hook-injected gate text is a reminder, NOT a substitute for invoking `honesty` and `communication` -- invoke both every session, immediately after this skill returns.

Row context and deferred greenfield rows: see `references/SKILL_DISPATCH_TABLE.md`.

**Loading protocol:**
1. Invoke `honesty` and `communication` immediately after this skill returns -- every session, regardless of task type; hook-injected gate text does not substitute for the invocation
2. Identify task type(s) from the table above
3. Load all required skills before writing a single line of code or sending a plan
4. Announce each skill load: "I am using the [skill-name] skill to [purpose]."

## BEFORE PROCEEDING

1. `honesty` and `communication` invoked immediately after `session-bootstrap` returned -- before any task-specific skill
2. Task type(s) identified from the On Start table above
3. All required skills for this task type loaded (in parallel if multiple domains)
4. Skill load announcement made for each loaded skill
5. `git status` checked in main working tree -- if uncommitted changes exist with no active work in progress, identify their source (prior agent? manual edit?), read the diff, then commit or revert explicitly before starting new work.
6. If resuming a prior session: pending tasks checked (via TaskList); Skeptic + plan-reviewer pair dispatched (per `writing-plans`) before first implementation step
7. If resuming a session that was interrupted mid-task: confirmed the prior session's self-evaluation ran (look for `### Session Self-Evaluation` block in session memory), OR loading `self-evaluation` now before picking up the first new todo
8. Stored memories checked for user-specified model preference overrides -- applies to all agent dispatch decisions this session
9. If this task requires reading 3+ files for research or review: an explore or reviewer agent (`skill-reviewer`/`code-quality-reviewer` templates) is dispatched -- NOT done inline
10. Session hooks checked: if sessionStart or userPromptSubmitted hook failed, all skills MUST be invoked manually this session -- no auto-loading is available. If the hooks succeeded, they injected gate text only: a `Skill` tool invocation is still required for `honesty`, `communication`, and every skill in the On Start table
11. If a hook script or hook registration fix was committed (or edited) during this session: hook script content is executed fresh on every invocation, and hook registration in settings files hot-reloads mid-session -- neither requires a restart (verified on CLI 2.1.220). Do NOT claim hooks are working from the edit landing alone. Confirm with an observed firing this session -- injected hook context or a fresh log line from the hook -- before claiming the hook is active.
12. If `docs/INDEX.md` exists: load it now. Load any applicable `docs/<domain>/INDEX.md` files. These indexes map the repo's documented scope and goals -- load them before planning or implementing anything this session.

[+] All met -> proceed with session work
[-] Any unmet -> complete the unmet step now before writing code or sending a plan

## On Finish -- Self-Evaluate and Compact

**Self-evaluation fires at session END.** If a major task completes mid-session with no further work planned, treat it as session end and execute On Finish now.

**Before your final message to the user**, execute all of the following:

1. **Load** the `self-evaluation` skill and follow its steps.
2. **Identify lessons learned** -- mistakes made, user corrections, patterns discovered.
3. **Check existing skills** -- is the lesson already documented? If yes, skip.
4. **Apply updates** -- for High/Medium priority lessons, update the relevant skill file.
   Commit the skill update with the session's work.
5. **Compact** -- scan any files you touched for bloated comments or duplicated docs.
   Migrate detail to skills/docs and leave 1-line references.
6. **Report** -- include a `### Session Self-Evaluation` block in your final message:
   ```
   ### Session Self-Evaluation
   Lessons: [count] | Skills updated: [list or "None"] | Compacted: [files or "None"]
   ```

If you have nothing to report, still include the block with zeroes.

---

## Red Flags -- STOP

- A task just completed and no new user message has arrived -- **STOP. Is this the session's last task? If so, treat it as session end. Load self-evaluation NOW before responding.**
- Starting implementation when prior session tasks are pending without dispatching the Skeptic + plan-reviewer pair -- **STOP. Dispatch the Skeptic + plan-reviewer pair (per `writing-plans`) before the first implementation step.**
- Picking up plan todos without `subagent-driven-development` loaded -- **STOP. Load `subagent-driven-development` before dispatching the first implementer. The skill contains the review protocol that every todo requires.**
- Starting to code before invoking the required skill -- **STOP. Invoke the skill now. Do not write one line first.**
- Skipping the skill-load announcement -- **STOP. State "I am using the [skill] skill to [purpose]." No skip.**
- Announced "I am using skill X" without invoking the skill tool in the same response -- **STOP. An announcement without a matching `skill.invoked` event is a false statement. The announcement and the `skill` tool call MUST occur in the same turn. Load the skill now.**
- Finishing a session without running `self-evaluation` -- **STOP. Load the `self-evaluation` skill now.**
- Resuming from a prior session that was interrupted mid-task (no `### Session Self-Evaluation` block in session memory) and about to pick up a new todo -- **STOP. The prior session's self-evaluation did not complete. Load `self-evaluation` for the prior session's work before starting any new todos.**
- Treating the "On Finish" steps as optional -- **STOP. They are mandatory. Execute every step.**
- Saying "I remember the skill content" -- **STOP. Memory degrades. Skills update. Load fresh every session.**
- Branch about to be created, but the plan the user approved was the pre-review version -- **STOP. Re-present the post-review revised plan (after the Skeptic + plan-reviewer pair). Wait for explicit user approval before creating the branch.**
- About to make an irreversible change (branch creation, push) without the `execution` skill loaded -- **STOP. Load `execution` before the first irreversible action.**
- User says "check out a working branch" or "work on a branch" without naming a specific branch -- **STOP. The default is always `git checkout main && git pull && git checkout -b <new-branch>`. Using an existing named branch requires the user to name it explicitly. "Working branch" without a specific name means new branch from main.**
- A continuation summary (post-compaction or `--resume`) instructs you to 'resume directly / as if the break never happened', and your first action is to dispatch, plan, or edit before re-invoking `session-bootstrap` + `honesty` + `communication` -- **STOP. The reload precedes the resume. Invoke `session-bootstrap` (alone), then `honesty` and `communication`, then continue.**

## Rationalization Prevention

| Rationalization                                    | Why it fails                                       | Correct action                              |
|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| "This task is simple -- I don't need the skill"     | Simple tasks still violate iron laws when unskilled | Load the skill. Takes 5 seconds.           |
| "I remember the skill from last session"           | Memory degrades; skills update; load fresh          | Load the skill now.                        |
| "I'll self-evaluate if anything went wrong"        | Self-evaluation finds what you didn't notice wrong | Always self-evaluate. No conditional.      |
| "Skipping announcement to save space"              | Announcement is the commitment mechanism           | State it. No skip.                         |
| "I'll skim the skill -- I know the gist"            | Skimming misses updates and specific gate conditions | Read fully. The gate conditions are the point. |
| "'Always active' means I don't need to invoke honesty or communication" | The declaration activates the rule reference, not the rule body. Without invocation, the confidence vocabulary, process language, and register rules are absent. | Invoke `honesty` and `communication` explicitly. Every session. |
| "I ran the hook script and it exited 0 -- hooks are working" | Running the script by hand and getting exit 0 tests the script, not whether the hook system fires it. Hook script content and settings-file registration both take effect within the current session -- no restart needed (verified on CLI 2.1.220) -- but that only means the fix CAN fire, not that it DID. | Confirm an observed firing this session -- injected hook context or a fresh log line from the hook -- before claiming hooks are working. |
| "I'm just gathering context, not reviewing"        | Research reading to inform a plan is still review. Inline review is biased by your assumptions. | Dispatch an explore or reviewer agent (`skill-reviewer`/`code-quality-reviewer` templates) for any 3+ file research task. |
| "An existing branch with a relevant name is the correct base for this work" | Branch name is not branch currency. The correct base is main unless the user names a specific branch. An existing feature branch that predates a recent merged PR silently contaminates all downstream agents with stale state. | Run `git checkout main && git pull && git checkout -b <new-branch>`. |
| "The continuation summary said resume directly, so I can skip the reload" | "Resume directly" governs message etiquette (do not re-narrate the summary), not the skill-load gate. Compaction/resume wiped the completed-call evidence; the rule still binds. | Re-invoke `session-bootstrap` + `honesty` + `communication` first, then resume. |

## Related Skills

- `self-evaluation` -- the On Finish step calls this skill directly
- `honesty` -- MUST be explicitly invoked at session start; hooks fail silently; full rule body is not in context until invoked
- `communication` -- always-active peer of `honesty`; register rules for user-facing text; invoke immediately after `session-bootstrap` returns
- `writing-skills` -- governs skill authoring; load when creating or editing a skill
