# Recurring Defect Registry

A shared, cross-repo catalog of recurring agent-behavior defects, mined from real user
corrections, plus a small number of entries contributed from external-reviewer session
self-audits (marked inline). Use it in a postmortem: when a defect recurs, look it up here to
see whether it is a known pattern and where its remedy lives.

## Provenance

- Mined 2026-07-19 from 520 real assistant->user pairs across 39 session transcripts
  (harness-injected pseudo-user turns -- task-notifications, system-reminders, skill-load
  bodies -- filtered out).
- 140 of those pairs are user corrections, grouped into 46 canonical failure modes.
- Sources: story-to-ship 92, prior C++ project 46, other-project 2 (= 140).
- Every correction is grounded in a real quoted user message. That grounding is the only
  thing claimed as "verified" -- see the maps-to note below.
- The registry now holds 47 entries: 46 from the 2026-07-19 user-correction mining run (grouped
  into 46 canonical failure modes, below) plus RD-47, contributed 2026-07-23 from an
  external-reviewer session self-audit (the a0e656aa drift-postmortem). RD-47 is grounded in
  that postmortem's event log, not a quoted user correction, so the "every correction is
  grounded in a real quoted user message" claim above scopes to the 46 mined modes only.

## Schema

Each entry has:
- `RD-NN` -- stable id, ordered by descending instance count at mining time.
- `signature` -- one line: what went wrong.
- `count` / `domain` -- number of mined instances; `general`, or a domain tag used for
  cross-repo routing.
- `maps-to` -- a ROUTING POINTER to the nearest existing remedy (a memory slug or a skill).
  It is NOT a claim the mode is solved or cannot recur. `GAP` means no existing remedy is
  catalogued; those entries carry an inline `remediation` line.

## How to use

1. A defect recurs in a session. Search this file for its signature.
2. If present and `maps-to` names a memory or skill, load that remedy.
3. If `GAP`, apply the inline `remediation`; if it recurs again, promote it to a memory or
   skill rule.

## Scope and limits

- This is a curated point-in-time snapshot (2026-07-19), not an auto-updated view, plus a small
  number of post-2026-07-19 additions contributed from external-reviewer self-audits (see
  Provenance). The mining METHOD (scan transcripts -> filter injected turns -> classify
  corrections -> name mode -> map to remedy) is reproducible, but the source transcripts are
  private and are not committed, so there is no one-command regeneration from repo state.
- Singletons (count 1) are candidates, not confirmed patterns -- flagged as such in-line;
  a few carry an explicit remediation where the corrective is already known.
- The schema (portable mode names, maps-to slugs, domain tags) is repo-agnostic so other
  repos can adopt or sync entries later; no sync mechanism exists yet.

---

### RD-01: missing-visual-verification
- signature: Claimed a UI or visual result was correct from quantitative checks (comparison tests passing) without qualitatively observing the actual running output.
- count: 18 (mined 2026-07-19)   domain: general
- maps-to: GAP (inline remediation below)
- remediation: A qualitative check -- actually observing the output of the running UI application (a screenshot or the live app) -- is required before claiming visual correctness; quantitative checks (comparison tests passing) do not substitute for it.

### RD-02: bootstrap-not-fired
- signature: Did not invoke session-bootstrap first after start, resume, or compaction.

### RD-03: unbacked-causal-diagnosis
- signature: Stated a root cause without a trace or reproduction.
- count: 12 (mined 2026-07-19)   domain: general
- maps-to: skill: systematic-debugging

### RD-04: scope-overreach
- signature: Did more or other than the task asked; touched out-of-scope surface.
- count: 8 (mined 2026-07-19)   domain: general
- maps-to: skill: execution

### RD-05: unverified-claim
- signature: Asserted a fact about code or state without reading or running it.

- maps-to: memory: feedback_correctness_over_completion

### RD-06: premature-or-wrong-edit

- count: 6 (mined 2026-07-19)   domain: general
- maps-to: skill: execution

### RD-07: unbacked-confidence-claim
- signature: Claimed verification happened with no evidence shown.
- count: 6 (mined 2026-07-19)   domain: general
- maps-to: skill: honesty

### RD-08: unchecked-existing-state
- signature: Acted on assumed or stale state without checking current live state.
- count: 6 (mined 2026-07-19)   domain: general
- maps-to: GAP (inline remediation below)
- remediation: Before creating, opening, or acting, query current live state (open tasks, PRs, skill versions, prior-session outputs); never act from memory of an old session.

### RD-09: banned-language-used
- signature: Used banned honesty vocabulary in output.
- count: 5 (mined 2026-07-19)   domain: general
- maps-to: skill: honesty (confidence class) / communication (hedge class)

### RD-10: weak-imperative-language
- signature: Authored 'should/prefer/consider' where a MUST was required.
- count: 5 (mined 2026-07-19)   domain: general
- maps-to: skill: writing-skills

### RD-11: bare-completion-claim
- signature: Claimed done/complete/CI-pass -- or any declare-clean checkpoint verdict (batch complete, 0 residual, all covered, verified, root cause X) -- without inline command output or a citation to prior evidence.
- count: 4 (mined 2026-07-19)   domain: general
- maps-to: skill: honesty
- note: signature BROADENED 2026-07-23 from the external-reviewer self-audit of session a0e656aa (the drift-postmortem), not the 2026-07-19 user-correction mining run; `count: 4` reflects the PRE-broadening signature and is not re-tallied under the broadened definition (source transcripts are private/uncommitted -- no regeneration).
- see also: RD-47 (re-assertion decay) -- when the bare claim is a RESTATED prior verdict rather than a first-time unbacked claim.
- detector: offline precision/recall harness at `tools/evaluation_evidence_gate/` (`judge_prompt.md` defines the claim classes; also cited by `agents/postmortem-reviewer.md` for the empirical-backing precision split).

### RD-12: skeptic-not-dispatched

- count: 3 (mined 2026-07-19)   domain: general
- maps-to: GAP (inline remediation below)
- remediation: Session artifacts (self-assessment.md, postmortem.md) go in the session directory, never the repo; confirm the skill's stated path before writing.

### RD-16: skill-not-reloaded
- signature: Acted in a skill's domain without invoking or reloading the skill.

- maps-to: GAP (inline remediation below)
- remediation: When a recurring issue needs a durable rule, fix the tracked source skill, not a private memory or a plugin-cache/temp copy; edits to a plugins/cache snapshot are outside git and are silently overwritten on the next plugin update. For a repo-specific or plugin skill, edit the source repo's skill file and ship it through review.

- signature: Treated private memory as a shared or authoritative record.
- count: 1 (mined 2026-07-19)   domain: general

- remediation: candidate (1 instance -- not yet a confirmed pattern).

### RD-44: thin-todo-tracking-causes-compaction-loss

### RD-47: bare-re-assertion-decay
- signature: Re-asserted a prior verdict (a completion, a coverage claim, OR a causal/mechanism diagnosis) without a pointer to the original evidence (msg # / file:line) and without re-deriving it now.
- count: n/a (added 2026-07-23 from the external-reviewer self-audit of session a0e656aa -- the drift-postmortem -- not the 2026-07-19 user-correction mining run)   domain: general
- maps-to: skill: honesty (the Empirical-Backing Tripwire re-assertion rule)
- see also: RD-11 (bare-completion-claim) -- the first-time-unbacked declare-clean sibling of this re-assertion-specific mode.
